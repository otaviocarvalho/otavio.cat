Hey, I'm Otávio Carvalho! A [gaucho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaucho) from the infinite plains of the [pampas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampas) in [southern Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelotas), and currently based in [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona).

I've spent the last 10+ years obsessing over distributed systems — first in academia, then in industry. I did my BSc and MSc in Computer Science at UFRGS ([top CS university in Latin America](https://edurank.org/cs/la/)), where I published research on distributed systems, cloud computing, edge computing, and IoT as part of the [GPPD research group](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/gppd/site/). You can dig into those papers on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=fs4NFgMAAAAJ).

Now I'm a Lead Engineer at New Relic, working on Distributed Event Processing for the [Entity Platform](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/new-relic-one-entity-centric) — processing over a billion messages per minute via Kafka. More on my engineering journey on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/otaviocarvalho/).

Lately I've been diving into AI agent orchestration, observability for AI agents, and how distributed systems and formal methods can be applied to AI agents coordination.

You can find me on [X](https://x.com/otavioccc), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/otavioccc.bsky.social), [GitHub](https://github.com/otaviocarvalho) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/otaviocarvalho/) or contact me directly via [hi@otavio.cat](mailto:hi@otavio.cat).
